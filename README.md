# 🥤 Vending Machine Simulation (Octave/MATLAB)

This project is a graphical vending machine simulation developed using GNU Octave / MATLAB.

It allows users to:
- Select products
- View prices
- Make payments
- Track remaining balance
- Receive change
- Complete purchases interactively

The project was developed as part of the **Introduction to Engineering** course.
